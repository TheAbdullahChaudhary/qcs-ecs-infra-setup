- [ ] Test database connectivity from backend task

### If Frontend Service Fails

## üìù Important Notes

### Security Considerations
- [ ] Database runs in private subnets
- [ ] Backend runs in private subnets
- [ ] Only frontend is accessible from internet
- [ ] EFS volume is encrypted in transit
- [ ] Security groups follow least privilege principle

### Performance Considerations
- [ ] Database has 1024 MB memory for better performance
- [ ] EFS provides persistent storage across AZs
- [ ] Services can be scaled independently
- [ ] Load balancer distributes traffic across tasks

### Monitoring Considerations
- [ ] All logs are centralized in CloudWatch
- [ ] Health checks monitor service availability
- [ ] ECS service metrics are available
- [ ] Database logs show connection and query information
